        ##### Objective
        This app is a demo on how to use
        [streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit)
        multipages feature and
        [streamlit-login-auth-ui](https://github.com/GauriSP10/streamlit_login_auth_ui)
        package used to authenticate a user. The main page is
        <span style="color: magenta;">**sports**</span> with subpages
        <span style="color: magenta;">**basketball**</span>
        and <span style="color: magenta;">**football**</span>.

        The `pages` folder has
        `02_üèÄ_Basketball.py` and `03_‚öΩ_Football.py` files. This app also has
        `modules` folder that contains `baskeball.py`, `football.py` and other
        files that support the files in the pages folder. The **class** and
        **functions** from these files are imported to the files in `pages` folder.
        The basketball and football pages have the FIBA and FIFA ranking list
        respectively. They can only be seen when a user is logged in.
        The source code of this app can be found in my
        [github](https://github.com/fsmosca/multipage-login-auth) repository.
        ##### Authentication
        If a <span style="color: magenta;">**Logout**</span> button appears
        in the sidebar on this page, that means a user is logged in.
        To log in, a user has to **create an
        account** and use the username and password. Username, password
        and <span style="color: magenta;">**email**</span> are important.
        The **email** is used when a user forgets the password.
        [argon2-cffi](https://pypi.org/project/argon2-cffi/) manages the
        password hashing.
        The user info along with the hashed password is saved in the file
        `_secret_auth_.json` by default under the streamlit project folder. The filename
        can be changed with the use of the **secrets.toml** file when deployed locally,
        or with the use of
        [secrets management](https://docs.streamlit.io/streamlit-cloud/get-started/deploy-an-app/connect-to-data-sources/secrets-management)
        when deployed in **streamlit cloud**. Saving the users info in the free streamlit
        cloud is not safe. It is better to save it to a cloud database. The package
        [streamlit_login_auth_ui](https://github.com/GauriSP10/streamlit_login_auth_ui) under branch [username-is-not-case-sensitive](https://github.com/fsmosca/streamlit_login_auth_ui/tree/username-is-not-case-sensitive) now
        supports saving the users info in the [deta](https://www.deta.sh/) database.
        This app saves users info in deta base. Note deta is free.

        ```python
        from streamlit_login_auth_ui.mydeta import deta_db

        detadb = None
        users_auth_file = st.secrets['secrets_users_auth_file']
        auth_token = st.secrets['secrets_courier_auth_token']

        # Save users info to deta base.
        deta_project_key = st.secrets['Deta_Project_Key']
        deta_db_name = st.secrets['Deta_Db_Name']
        detadb = deta_db(deta_project_key, deta_db_name)

        __login__obj = __login__(
            auth_token=auth_token,
            company_name="Shims",
            width=200,
            height=250,
            logout_button_name='Logout',
            hide_menu_bool=False,
            hide_footer_bool=False,
            lottie_url='https://assets2.lottiefiles.com/packages/lf20_jcikwtux.json',
            users_auth_file=users_auth_file,
            is_disable_login=False,
            detadb=detadb)

        is_logged_in = __login__obj.build_login_ui()
        if is_logged_in:
            do_stuff()  # This is your entry after successfull log in.
        ```

        ##### The courier service
        [Courier](https://www.courier.com/) handles the email notification
        when user forgets the password. It will send a temporary password
        to the user via the email specified by the user during account
        creation. The user can then reset the password.
        The **developer** should register in Courier site in order to get the
        **courier-auth-token** so that the email notification will work. There is
        a [free tier](https://www.courier.com/pricing/) with a decent number
        of messages to use per month. It is fine not to register though,
        <span style="color: magenta;">**streamlit-login-auth-ui**</span>
        still allows account creation and user log in/out.
