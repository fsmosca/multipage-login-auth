    ##### Objective

    This app is a demo on how to use
    [streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit)
    multipages feature and
    [streamlit-login-auth-ui](https://github.com/GauriSP10/streamlit_login_auth_ui)
    package used to authenticate a user. The main page is
    <span style="color: magenta;">**sports**</span> with subpages
    <span style="color: magenta;">**basketball**</span>
    and <span style="color: magenta;">**football**</span>.
    
    The `pages` folder has
    `02_üèÄ_Basketball.py` and `03_‚öΩ_Football.py` files. This app also has
    `modules` folder that contains `baskeball.py`, `football.py` and other
    files that support the files in the pages folder. The **class** and
    **functions** from these files are imported to the files in `pages` folder.

    The basketball and football pages have the FIBA and FIFA ranking list
    respectively. They can only be seen when a user is logged in.

    The source code of this app can be found in my
    [github](https://github.com/fsmosca/multipage-login-auth) repository.

    ##### Authentication

    If a <span style="color: magenta;">**Logout**</span> button appears
    in the sidebar on this page, that means a user is logged in.
    To log in, a user has to **create an
    account** and use the username and password. Username, password
    and <span style="color: magenta;">**email**</span> are important.
    The **email** is used when a user forgets the password.
    [argon2-cffi](https://pypi.org/project/argon2-cffi/) manages the
    password hashing.

    The user info along with the hashed password is saved in the file
    `_secret_auth_.json` under the streamlit project folder.

    ##### The courier service

    [Courier](https://www.courier.com/) handles the email notification
    when user forgets the password. It will send a temporary password
    to the user via the email specified by the user during account
    creation. The user can then reset the password.

    The **developer** should register in Courier site in order to get the
    **courier-auth-token** so that the email notification will work. There is
    a [free tier](https://www.courier.com/pricing/) with a decent number
    of messages to use per month. It is fine not to register though,
    <span style="color: magenta;">**streamlit-login-auth-ui**</span>
    still allows account creation and user log in/out.
